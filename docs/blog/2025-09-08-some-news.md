The next _Node diversity workshop_, where Cardano developers focusing on building various kind of nodes will meet in Toulouse, is just around the corner. It therefore seemed a good idea to share an update on the Antithesis project initiated by the Cardano Foundation, especially as representatives from Antithesis and the teams working on this project will attend the workshop!

And although it's been while since we have shared news in our [latest blog post](./2025-05-01-poc-results.md), the project hasn't stayed still and we made progress on a number of fronts, ready for the next phase namely its transformation from an experiment restricted to a small team to a community-lead resource.

## Testing cardano-node with Antithesis

Since May we have been running Antithesis on a cluster of 5 cardano-nodes as part of the _Continuous Integration_ process of the project, leveraging the existing _Github Action_ to trigger test runs. Those test runs have been done on the latest available versions of the Docker image of cardano-node, on the `master` branch, and checking a limited number of basic properties on top of the ones provided by Antithesis out-of-the-box:

* The main property checked is implemented in the [eventually-converged.sh](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/moog/blob/main/compose/sidecar/composer/convergence/eventually_converged.sh) script and, as its name implies, checks that all nodes have reached the same tip _eventually_. The fact this is an [eventually](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/test_composer_reference/#eventually-command) command is critically important as it guarantees it will be run and its status checked at the end of the test run and without any more faults injected. It took us a while to refine the property and work with the Antithesis team to ensure it does not produce false positives,
* We also check 2 _Never_ properties related to logs emitted by the cardano-node: That it never emits `Error` or `Critical` logs.

Note that by default Antithesis checks a number of other properties, like the fact no container exits unexpectedly, or that the processes run never go over 95% of the memory available.

The team's effort has not been particularly focused on finding bugs, but we still managed to report a couple of potentially "interesting" issues to the core developers: One issue related to DNS resolution failure timeout, and a potential race condition in the shutdown/startup sequence.

## Tracking test runs on-chain

The main goal of this project has always been to open access to the Antithesis resource to the Cardano community, in a transparent, fair, and as easy as possible way. And what's better than a blockchain like Cardano to manage access to a shared resource transparently? Furthermore, as developers of _Cardano_ systems it seems quite logical and inline with the principle of [_dogfooding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) to insist on using Cardano itself in our development workflow.

Once convinced about the capabilities of the tool, we started designing and building a Cardano-based system that would allow developers to "easily" request test runs for their particular software stack, and receive results and reports once produced by the platform. Version 0.2.0.0 of the command-line tool called _anti-cli_ has [just been released](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/moog/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0) and it provides the core features needed to manage the lifecycle of Antithesis tests for any system hosted on Github[^1].

_Anti-cli_ leverages [Merkle-Patricia Forestry Service](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/mpfs) as a backend-service to store data off-chain with proofs verifiable on-chain. This service is in turn based on the excellent Aiken [Merkle-Patricia Forestry](https://github.com/aiken-lang/merkle-patricia-forestry) library.

The following picture illustrates the overall design of this application and how it interacts with the chain and the Antithesis service:

![anti-cli interactions](/img/anti-cli-interactions.jpg)

The developer, here **Alice** uses _anti-cli_ to post test run requests and retrieve test run results from the MPFS service. MPFS service is used to compute unsigned transactions necessary for the parties to operate index the blockchain to track and serve the state of the interaction. It can be run locally, giving it access to a node, or parties can use a remote instance (see [mpfs repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/mpfs)).

On the other side, the **Agent** is reponsible for _mediating_ and curating run requests, forward those requests to the Antithesis service, retrieve the tests result, and finally notify the results on-chain for **Alice**'s consumption. Note that because of the sensitive nature of test results, the report's URL posted on-chain is encrypted using **Alice**'s public key which in turns require them to record this key as part of their registration process.

More details can be found in the [anti-cli documentation](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/moog).

## Testing Amaru in Antithesis

[Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) is an alternative node implemented in Rust which is being actively developed by a small but dedicated team under the umbrella of [PRAGMA](https://pragma.io/), a _Member-Based Organisation_ dedicated exclusively to foster open-source projects. As such it's a prime candidate to prove Antithesis' relevance for the development of core systems in Cardano beside the cardano-node itself.

It took the team some time to get there, as there were quite a few moving parts to get right in order to be able to run a cluster of cardano-nodes and amaru nodes[^2], but we finally managed to run our first Antithesis in the past couple of weeks.

The setup is pretty simple: We spin up a network of 5 block producing cardano-nodes and 2 Amaru nodes in client mode, with one of the Amarus connected to a cardano-node and the other one to the previous Amaru node. While the test run itself wasn't successful, which is expected given the current state of development of Amaru, this is nevertheless a huge step forward for us.

Details of the setup can be found in the [Amaru codebase](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/tree/main/docker/testnet). This initial success paves the way for quickly pinpointing main shortcomings in Amaru and target development effort accordingly first to make sure Amaru can be a reliable relay and then turn into a full-fledged block producer.

## Adversarial node & network

A key feature of Antithesis is its ability to inject faults in the _System-under-test_. [Currently](https://antithesis.com/docs/environment/fault_injection/), Antithesis can trigger various kind of network-related faults like dropped or delayed packets, disconnections, split-brains ; cpu and memory throttling to simulate sudden limitation of resources ; or random crashes. But as clearly stated in the documentation page, those faults are very generic and simulate faults from the environment but not really _adversarial_ behaviour, and as we are the ones knowing our system best it rests on us to produce more interesting _faults_.

Following initial discussions with the Consensus team we have started work on an [Adversarial Node](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/moog/blob/main/adversary/README.md). This is intended to be an extensible and configurable application that can be triggered by Antithesis platform during tests to emulate adversarial behaviour at the protocol and logic level. Our very first "adversary" is quite mild in its "attacks" on nodes
as it merely tries to open several connections to a node and start synchronising the chain from random points in the past. Its goal is to expose potential issues in the way a node tracks _Chain followers_, eg. memory leaks, concurrency issues, network resources allocation...

A key design constraint of the _Adversary_ is that it should only act through Cardano protocols, without any prior knowledge of the implementation of the nodes it connects to. This makes it possible to use the _Adversary_ in any valid Cardano-network and running against any piece of software implementing Cardano protocols, whether at the network, consensus, or even ledger level[^3].

## Conclusion & Future work

While the _High-Assurance Lab_ team at Cardano foundation has made great progress to turn what started as an experiment and proof-of-concept a few months ago into a full-fledged usable project, there obviously remains a lot to be done. Our end goal is to build tools and systems that benefit the Cardano ecosystem a as whole by providing easy-to-use, transparent, and safe access to a sophisticated testing tools empowering teams with state-of-the-art system-level testing infrastructure.

But we also want these tools and systems to be _owned_ by the community in order to ensure adequate funding and proper governance of something we believe can increase the level of quality, resilience, and therefore confidence in Cardano. That's why we are eager to engage with "node builders" around the globe, and to collaborate with all teams and projects building core infrastructure components and applications to make the most out of this effort.
