# Introduction

Moog is operated by [the Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/).

Operating Moog requires:

- having an [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com/) account in which to execute
  test runs
- running several services
  * the Oracle which knows how to query GitHub and has access to the Cardano
    Foundation's Antithesis account;
  * the MPFS service which stores the facts on the blockchain
- interventions by a human agent.

The details of how to do this are described in the rest of the Operations
Manual.
