# Oracle role

This is the role of the user that wants to run a service to control access to the Antithesis platform. There will be only one token and so there will be only one oracle service running at a time, but we document it here for completeness.

## Running the oracle service

You can build an executable that will continuously check for pending requests and include them in the Antithesis token.

### Build

You can build the oracle service via nix:

```bash
nix build .#anti-oracle
```

On a linux machine you can build a docker container

```bash
nix build .#anti-oracle-docker-image
docker load < result
```

Then you can run the docker container

```bash
version=$(nix eval .#version --raw)
docker run ghcr.io/cardano-foundation/antithesis/anti-oracle:$version
```

## Running oracle commands manually

Alternatively, oracle commands can be run manually, using the `anti` CLI. See the [README.md](../README.md) for how to install it.

## Creating the anti token (only once)

Oracle operations need a wallet. Since the oracle role is critical, in addition to setting the `ANTI_WALLET_FILE` environment variable to point to the wallet file, you should also set the `ANTI_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` environment variable to encrypt the wallet.

You can create a wallet with the `anti wallet create` command.

```bash
anti wallet create
```

The current oracle wallet reports

```bash
anti wallet info
```

```json
{
  "address": "addr_test1vq04e6lvknx3ettppz5xq9x7nk8j87w5gaammke7z2ymyfqtkl4vv",
  "filePath": "tmp/oracle.json",
  "owner": "1f5cebecb4cd1cad6108a86014de9d8f23f9d4477bbddb3e1289b224"
}
```

To create the Antithesis token, you can use the `anti oracle token create` command.

```bash
anti oracle token boot
```

It will create the Antithesis token. This token is a unique identifier for the Antithesis platform and will be used by all users to interact with the platform. You have to distribute it so that users can set the `ANTI_TOKEN_ID` environment variable to point to it.

You can review the token info anytime with

```bash
anti token | jq .state
```

Critically the owner matches the wallet owner.

## Updating the anti token

The main responsibility of the oracle is to include change requests in the Antithesis token.

Pending change requests can be queried with the `anti token` command.

```bash
anti token | jq '.requests'
```

In the requests field you will notice the `validation` field, which will be set to `validated` for all requests that have been validated .

Once you decided what to include in the Antithesis token, you can commit the requests to the token.

Updating the token with new requests is done with the `anti oracle token update` command. As with retract you have to provide the `outputRefId` of the request you want to update. Multiple requests can be updated at once, so you can provide multiple `-o` options.

```bash
anti oracle token update -o b6fc7cca5bcae74e6a5983f7922d0e0985285f1f19e62ccc9cb9fd4d3766a81b-0
```

## Deleting the anti token (DANGEROUS)

To delete the Antithesis token, you can use the `anti oracle token delete` command.

```bash
anti oracle token delete
```

## Publishing the oracle configuration

Before requesters can request test-runs, the oracle should select the agent identity and in general expose validation parameters so that the requesters and the agent can pre-validate their requests.

This is done with the `anti oracle config set` command.


```bash
anti oracle config set  --min-test-duration MIN_TEST_HOURS --max-test-duration MAX_TEST_HOURS --agent-pkh PUBLIC_KEY_HASH
```

In this situation the oracle is acting like a user and so this request will end up in the Antithesis token as a request for change.

*Apply the token update command to commit the request to the Antithesis token*

This will end up in a fact and so anyone can inspect it with the `anti facts` command.

```bash
anti facts config
```
