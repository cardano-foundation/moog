# Overview

Users of Moog submit requests for an Antithesis test involving Cardano nodes to
be run. They should read the [User Manual](user/intro.md).

Moog is operated by the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/).
This involves a combination of running automated services and human agents
performing manual tasks. This is all described in the [Operations Manual](ops/intro.md).
