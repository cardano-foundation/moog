# Overview

Moog is a portal to the [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com/) service. It makes
it possible for an organisation that has an Antithesis licence to provide to
other users the opportunity to submit their own Antithesis tests, which will
then be run by the organisation that has access to Antithesis. The details of
this transaction is then stored on the Cardano blockchain.

We call ***users*** of Moog the people who wish to submit requests for an
Antithesis test to be run. They should read the [User Manual](user/intro.md).

We call ***operators*** of Moog the people who are providing a portal to their
Antithesis instance. This involves setting up some infrastructure, running
automated services, as well as having human agents performing occasional tasks.
This is all described in the [Operations Manual](ops/intro.md).

In particular, the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) is
currently operating the prototype implementation of a Moog portal to allow
developers within the Cardano ecosystem to use run Antithesis tests, in an
effort to contribute to improving the quality of software within the Cardano
ecosystem.
