# Contributing to Moog

Thank you for considering to contribute to Moog and help the Cardano community
improve the security of the network!

We especially welcome help improving the documentation and packaging.

We use a [Radicle][Radicle] repository (GitHub is only a mirror), so the preferred way of
contributing is to clone the [Radicle repository][Repo] and use Radicle to open
issues or submit patches.

Other ways to get in touch are provided on the [Moog website][Moog].

The Moog project consists of three subprojects:

- cli
- adversary
- compose

See README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md in each of these.
