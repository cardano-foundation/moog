# Moog

Moog is for Cardano testing with Antithesis.

The [Cardano blockchain's][Cardano] core node software implements complex
algorithms and protocols who run in a networked, concurrent context. Many
nodes, some of which could be adversarial, collaborate to achieve the overall
system's behaviour of being a decentralized, immutable ledger. Such a system is
subject to many unpredictable factors such as communication delays, network
partitions, nodes appearing or disappearing.

[Antithesis][Antithesis] is a testing tool which is capable of generating
random events (such as communication delays, network partitions, nodes
appearing or disappearing) in a simulated environment, such that if any
specific random sequence of combination of events leads to a software error, it
can be reproduced.

Moog aims to facilitate the use of Antithesis for testing various
components of the Cardano ecosystem, while tracking these test efforts on the
blockchain.

## Pre-requisites

Moog is intended for Cardano developers and builders. Familiarity with the
Cardano network, its tools and ecosystem is required.

Moog runs on MacOS and Linux.

Before using Moog there are several preliminary steps, including creating
a wallet and registering yourself as a user. These are described in the
user manual.

## Getting started

Instructions for end-users are available on the [Moog website][Moog].

Instructions for contributors and developers are in
[Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Usage

Moog is used via a command-line-interface (CLI). If you have followed the
"Getting started" instructions you can check you have a working system by
invoking:

```
moog --help
```

This should print out Moog's inline help.

Further instructions for setting up and using Moog are in the user manuals
available on the [Moog webiste][Moog].
